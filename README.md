# Athlete Tracker Phone App
Image processing - Arduino - Android Studio - Python

Athlete Tracker is a product of weareable tech that gives you information about your movements. It was developed to be used during a sport session.

The hardware ... an acelerometer (mpu-6050), bluetooth (HC-05) module, Atmega328 microcontroller and a LED stripe. The microcontroller uses the information of the acelerometer to estimate the aceleration of the movement. This information is sended to the phone through the HC-05 module. The phone receives the aceleration info, and captures a video of the movement which is processed to track the wereable and graph the movement.
